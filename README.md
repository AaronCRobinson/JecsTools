**Note to players:** This mod will not change your game, but rather it lets modders do more, so you can have an even more amazing RimWorld experience.
	
**Note to modders:** This mod contains components that allow you to do many new and different things in RimWorld. Check out RoxxPloxx's guide for more info here: https://github.com/roxxploxx/RimWorldModGuide/wiki

*CompOversizedWeapon*
